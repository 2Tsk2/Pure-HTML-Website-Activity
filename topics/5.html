	<h2 id="i">>📗Verb Tenses</h2>
		<img src="../images/verbt.png" width="500px" height="300px" alt="image is either coruptted or missing"> 
			<p>Verbs come in three tenses: past, present, and future. The past is used to describe things that have already happened (e.g., earlier in the day,
				yesterday, last week, three years ago). The present tense is used to describe things that are happening right now, or things that are continuous.
			    The future tense describes things that have yet to happen (e.g., later, tomorrow, next week, next year, three years from now).
			</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="ii">>📘Simple Present Tense</h3>
		<p>The simple present is a verb tense with two main uses. We use the simple present tense when an action is happening right now, or when it happens 
		regularly (or unceasingly, which is why it’s sometimes called present indefinite). Depending on the person, the simple present tense is formed by using
		the root form or by adding –s or –es to the end.
		</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>I feel great!</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td>Pauline loves pie.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td>I’m sorry to hear that you’re sick.</td>
			</tr>
			
	
		</table>
	<p>The other is to talk about habitual actions or occurrences.:</p>
	<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
		<tr>
			<td>Example:</td>
			<td>Pauline practices the piano every day.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>Ms. Jackson travels during the summer.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>Hamsters run all night.</td>
		</tr>

	</table>
	<p>Typically, when we want to describe a temporary action that is currently in progress, we use the present 
		continuous: Pauline can’t come to the phone right now because she is brushing her teeth.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4 id="iii">>📗How to format the simple present</h4>
		<p>In the simple present, most regular verbs use the root form, except in the third-person singular 
		(which ends in –s).
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td><b>First-person singular:</b> I write </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Second-person singular:</b> You write </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Third-person singular:</b> he/she/it writes </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>First-person plural:</b> We write </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Second-person plural: </b>You write </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Third-person plural:</b> They write </td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>For a few verbs, the third-person singular ends with –es instead of –s. Typically, these are 
		verbs whose root form ends in o, ch, sh, th, ss, gh, or z.</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td><b>First-person singular:</b> I go </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Second-person singular:</b> You go </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Third-person singular:</b> he/she/it goes </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>First-person plural:</b> We go </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Second-person plural: </b>You go </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Third-person plural:</b> They go </td>
				</tr>		
				</table>
		<p>For most regular verbs, you put the negation of the verb before the verb, e.g., 
		“She won’t go” or “I don’t smell anything.”.</p>
		<p>The verb to be is irregular:
		</p>	
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td><b>First-person singular:</b> I am </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Second-person singular:</b> You are </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Third-person singular:</b> he/she/it is </td>

				<tr>
					<td><b>First-person plural:</b> We are </td>

	<h3 id="iv">>📕Present Perfect Tense</h3>
		<p>The present perfect tense is one of the common verb tenses in English, used to show an action that happened in
			the past that is directly related to the present, such as actions that are still continuing or that indicate a 
			change over time. We cover a complete list of when to use the present perfect tense below. 
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>I heard the doorbell</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>My keyboard is sticky</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Doorbell and keyboard are real things that can be sensed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conversely, an abstract noun is something that cannot be perceived by the senses.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>We can’t imagine the courage it took to do that.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>	
		<p>
		Courage is an abstract noun. Courage can’t be seen, heard, or sensed in any
		 other way, but we know it exists.
		</p>	
		<p>
			A collective noun denotes a group or collection of people or things.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>That pack of lies is disgraceful.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Pack of lies as used here is a collective noun. Collective nouns take a 
			singular verb as if they are one entity – in this case, the singular verb is.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>A pride of lions roamed the savanna.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Pride of lions is also a collective noun.
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="v">>📘Noun as subjects</h3>
		<p>
			Every sentence must have a subject, and that subject will always be a noun. The subject of a sentence is the person,
			place, or thing that is doing or being the verb in that sentence.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Maria is happy.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Maria is the subject of this sentence and the corresponding verb is a form of to be (is).
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="vi">>📔Noun as objects</h3>
		<p>
			Nouns can also be objects of a verb in a sentence. An object can be either a direct object (a noun that receives the
			action performed by the subject) or an indirect object (a noun that is the recipient of a direct object).
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Give the books to her</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Books is a direct object (what is being given) and her is the indirect object (who the books are being given to).
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="vii">>📗Noun as subject and object complements</h3>
		<p>
			Another type of noun use is called a subject complement. In this example, the noun teacher is
			used as a subject complement.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Mary is a teacher.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Subject complements normally follow linking verbs like to be, become, or seem. A teacher is what Mary is.
		</p>
		<p>
			A related usage of nouns is called an object complement.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Husband and wife are nouns used as object complements in this sentence. Verbs that denote making, 
			naming, or creating are often followed by object complements.
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="viii">>📕Appositive nouns and nouns as modifiers</h3>
		<p>
			An appositive noun is a noun that immediately follows another noun in order to further define or identify it.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>My brother, Michael is six years old.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Michael is an appositive here, further identifying the subject of the sentence, my brother.
		</p>
	<h2 id="ix">>📘Plural nouns</h2>
		<p>
			Plural nouns, unlike collective nouns, require plural verbs. Many English plural nouns can be 
			formed by adding -s or -es to the singular form, although there are many exceptions.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>cat-cats</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>These two cats are both black</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Note the plural verb are.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>tax-taxes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>house-houses</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
	<br>
	<h3 id="x">>📙Countable nouns vs. uncountable nouns</h3>
			<p>
				Countable nouns are nouns which can be counted, even if the number might be extraordinarily
				high (like counting all the people in the world). Countable nouns can be used with a/an, the, some, any, a few, and many.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Here is a cat.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Cat is singular and—obviously—countable.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Here are a few cats</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Here are some cats</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Uncountable nouns, or mass nouns,  are nouns that come in a state or quantity which is impossible to count; liquids
				are uncountable, as are things that act like liquids (sand, air). They are always considered to be singular, and can
				be used with some, any, a little, and much.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>An I.Q. test measures intelligence.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Intelligence is an uncountable noun.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Students don’t seem to have much homework these days.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				This example refers to an unspecified, unquantifiable amount of homework, so homework is an uncountable noun.
			</p>
		<h2 id="xi">>📗Possessive nouns</h2>
			<p>
				Possessive nouns are nouns which possess something; i.e., they have something. You can identify a possessive
				noun by the apostrophe; most nouns show the possessive with an apostrophe and an s.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>The cat's toy was missing.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				The cat possesses the toy, and we denote this by use of ’s at the end of cat.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a singular noun ends in the letter s or z, the same format often applies. This is a matter of style, 
				however, and some style guides suggest leaving off the extra s.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>I have been invited to the boss’s house for dinner.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Mrs. Sanchez’s coat is still hanging on the back of her chair.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Plural nouns ending in s take only an apostrophe to form a possessive.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>My nieces’ prom dresses were exquisite.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
