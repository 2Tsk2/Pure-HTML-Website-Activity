	<h2 id="i">>ðŸ“˜What Is A Noun?</h2>
		<img src="./images/noun.png" width="500px" height="300px" alt="image is either coruptted or missing"> 
			<p>A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea.
			In a sentence, nouns can play the role of subject, direct object, indirect object,
			subject complement, object complement, appositive, or adjective.
			</p>
	<br>
	<h2 id="ii">>ðŸ“™Types of Nouns</h2>
		<p>Nouns form a large proportion of English vocabulary and they come in a wide variety 
		of types. Nouns can name a person:
		</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>Albert Einstein</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>the president</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>my mother</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>a girl</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	<p>Nouns can name a place:</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>Quezon City</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>Manila Ocean Park</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>my bedroom</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	<p>Nouns can also name things, although sometimes they might be intangible things,
	such as concepts, activities, or processes. Some might even be hypothetical or imaginary things.
	</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>shoe</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>justice</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>The Elder Wand</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>volleyball</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	<br>
	<h3 id="iii">>ðŸ“—Proper nouns vs. common nouns</h3>
		<p>One important distinction to be made is whether a noun is a proper noun or a common noun.
		 A proper noun is a specific name of a person, place, or thing, and is always capitalized.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Does Tina have much homework to do this evening?</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Tina is the name of a specific person</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>I would like to visit Rizal Park</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Luneta Park is the specific name of a park.</p>
		<p>The opposite of a proper noun is a common noun, sometimes known as a generic noun. A common 
		noun is the generic name of an item in a class or group and is not capitalized unless appearing at the beginning 
		of a sentence or in a title.
		</p>	
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>The man crossed the river.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Man is a common noun; we do not learn the identity of the man by reading this sentence, though we know the
		 action he takes. River is also a common noun in this sentence.
		</p>	
	<br>
	<h3 id="iv">>ðŸ“•Types of common nouns</h3>
		<p>Common or generic nouns can be broken down into three subtypes: concrete nouns, abstract nouns,
		 and collective nouns. A concrete noun is something that is perceived by the senses; something
		that is physical or real.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>I heard the doorbell</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>My keyboard is sticky</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Doorbell and keyboard are real things that can be sensed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conversely, an abstract noun is something that cannot be perceived by the senses.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>We canâ€™t imagine the courage it took to do that.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>	
		<p>
		Courage is an abstract noun. Courage canâ€™t be seen, heard, or sensed in any
		 other way, but we know it exists.
		</p>	
		<p>
			A collective noun denotes a group or collection of people or things.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>That pack of lies is disgraceful.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Pack of lies as used here is a collective noun. Collective nouns take a 
			singular verb as if they are one entity â€“ in this case, the singular verb is.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>A pride of lions roamed the savanna.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Pride of lions is also a collective noun.
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="v">>ðŸ“˜Noun as subjects</h3>
		<p>
			Every sentence must have a subject, and that subject will always be a noun. The subject of a sentence is the person,
			place, or thing that is doing or being the verb in that sentence.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Maria is happy.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Maria is the subject of this sentence and the corresponding verb is a form of to be (is).
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="vi">>ðŸ“”Noun as objects</h3>
		<p>
			Nouns can also be objects of a verb in a sentence. An object can be either a direct object (a noun that receives the
			action performed by the subject) or an indirect object (a noun that is the recipient of a direct object).
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Give the books to her</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Books is a direct object (what is being given) and her is the indirect object (who the books are being given to).
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="vii">>ðŸ“—Noun as subject and object complements</h3>
		<p>
			Another type of noun use is called a subject complement. In this example, the noun teacher is
			used as a subject complement.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Mary is a teacher.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Subject complements normally follow linking verbs like to be, become, or seem. A teacher is what Mary is.
		</p>
		<p>
			A related usage of nouns is called an object complement.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Husband and wife are nouns used as object complements in this sentence. Verbs that denote making, 
			naming, or creating are often followed by object complements.
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="viii">>ðŸ“•Appositive nouns and nouns as modifiers</h3>
		<p>
			An appositive noun is a noun that immediately follows another noun in order to further define or identify it.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>My brother, Michael is six years old.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Michael is an appositive here, further identifying the subject of the sentence, my brother.
		</p>
	<h2 id="ix">>ðŸ“˜Plural nouns</h2>
		<p>
			Plural nouns, unlike collective nouns, require plural verbs. Many English plural nouns can be 
			formed by adding -s or -es to the singular form, although there are many exceptions.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>cat-cats</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>These two cats are both black</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Note the plural verb are.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>tax-taxes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>house-houses</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
	<br>
	<h3 id="x">>ðŸ“™Countable nouns vs. uncountable nouns</h3>
			<p>
				Countable nouns are nouns which can be counted, even if the number might be extraordinarily
				high (like counting all the people in the world). Countable nouns can be used with a/an, the, some, any, a few, and many.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Here is a cat.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Cat is singular andâ€”obviouslyâ€”countable.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Here are a few cats</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Here are some cats</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Uncountable nouns, or mass nouns,  are nouns that come in a state or quantity which is impossible to count; liquids
				are uncountable, as are things that act like liquids (sand, air). They are always considered to be singular, and can
				be used with some, any, a little, and much.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>An I.Q. test measures intelligence.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Intelligence is an uncountable noun.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Students donâ€™t seem to have much homework these days.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				This example refers to an unspecified, unquantifiable amount of homework, so homework is an uncountable noun.
			</p>
		<h2 id="xi">>ðŸ“—Possessive nouns</h2>
			<p>
				Possessive nouns are nouns which possess something; i.e., they have something. You can identify a possessive
				noun by the apostrophe; most nouns show the possessive with an apostrophe and an s.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>The cat's toy was missing.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				The cat possesses the toy, and we denote this by use of â€™s at the end of cat.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a singular noun ends in the letter s or z, the same format often applies. This is a matter of style, 
				however, and some style guides suggest leaving off the extra s.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>I have been invited to the bossâ€™s house for dinner.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Mrs. Sanchezâ€™s coat is still hanging on the back of her chair.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Plural nouns ending in s take only an apostrophe to form a possessive.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>My niecesâ€™ prom dresses were exquisite.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
