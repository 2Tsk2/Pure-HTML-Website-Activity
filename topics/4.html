		<img src="../images/deter.png" width="500px" height="300px" alt="image is either coruptted or missing"> 
			<p>A determiner is a word placed in front of a noun to specify quantity (e.g., "one dog," "many dogs")
			or to clarify what the noun refers to (e.g., "my dog," "that dog," "the dog")
			All determiners can be classified as one of the following:
			</p>
	<br>
	<h2 id="ii">>ðŸ“˜Articles</h2>
		<p>The articles are the words "a," "an," and "the." They define whether something is specific or unspecific.
		There are two types of article:
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="iii">>ðŸ“™The Definite Article (The)</h3>
		<p>"The" is called the definite article. It defines its noun as something specific (e.g., something
		previously mentioned or known, something unique, something being identified by the speaker)
		</p>

				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>This is the lake.</td>

				</tr>
			</table>

	<h3 id="iv">>ðŸ“—The Indefinite Article (A, An)</h3>
		<p>"A" and "an" are called the indefinite articles. They define their noun as something unspecific 
		(e.g., something generic, something mentioned for the first time).
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>This is a lake.</td>

	<h2 id="v">>ðŸ“”Demonstratives</h2>
		<p>
			The demonstrative determiners (known as demonstrative adjectives in traditional grammar) are this, that, 
			these, and those. A demonstrative determiner defines where its noun or pronoun is in relation to the speaker.
		</p>
		<p>
			This and these define close things (in terms of distance, psychological closeness or time). That and those 
			define distant things.
		</p>
	<h3>>Examples of Demonstrative Determiners</h3>
	<p>In these examples, the noun or pronoun being modified is in bold.</p>
	<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">

			<td>ðŸ”µThis <b>shark</b> is pregnant.</td>

			<td>ðŸ”µThat <b>one </b>looks worried.</td>

				ðŸ”µIn these matters, the only certainty is nothing is certain. (Roman scientist Pliny the Elder)
			</td>
		</tr>
		
	</table>
	<h2 id="vi">>ðŸ“™Possessives</h2>
		<p>
			The possessive determiners (known as possessive adjectives in traditional grammar) are my, your,
			his, her, its, our, their, and whose. A possessive determiner sits before a noun (or a pronoun) to show who or what owns it.
		</p>
	<h3>>Examples of Possessive Determiners</h3>
		<p>In the examples below, the nouns being modified are in bold. The table also shows how each possessive determiner corresponds
		to a personal pronoun.</p>

	<h2 id="vii">>ðŸ“—Quantifiers</h2>
		<p>
			Another type of noun use is called a subject complement. In this example, the noun teacher is
			used as a subject complement.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Mary is a teacher.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Subject complements normally follow linking verbs like to be, become, or seem. A teacher is what Mary is.
		</p>
		<p>
			A related usage of nouns is called an object complement.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Husband and wife are nouns used as object complements in this sentence. Verbs that denote making, 
			naming, or creating are often followed by object complements.
		</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="viii">>ðŸ“•Appositive nouns and nouns as modifiers</h3>
		<p>
			An appositive noun is a noun that immediately follows another noun in order to further define or identify it.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>My brother, Michael is six years old.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Michael is an appositive here, further identifying the subject of the sentence, my brother.
		</p>
	<h2 id="ix">>ðŸ“˜Plural nouns</h2>
		<p>
			Plural nouns, unlike collective nouns, require plural verbs. Many English plural nouns can be 
			formed by adding -s or -es to the singular form, although there are many exceptions.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>cat-cats</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>These two cats are both black</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			Note the plural verb are.
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>tax-taxes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>house-houses</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
	<br>
	<h3 id="x">>ðŸ“™Countable nouns vs. uncountable nouns</h3>
			<p>
				Countable nouns are nouns which can be counted, even if the number might be extraordinarily
				high (like counting all the people in the world). Countable nouns can be used with a/an, the, some, any, a few, and many.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Here is a cat.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Cat is singular andâ€”obviouslyâ€”countable.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Here are a few cats</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Here are some cats</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Uncountable nouns, or mass nouns,  are nouns that come in a state or quantity which is impossible to count; liquids
				are uncountable, as are things that act like liquids (sand, air). They are always considered to be singular, and can
				be used with some, any, a little, and much.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>An I.Q. test measures intelligence.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Intelligence is an uncountable noun.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Students donâ€™t seem to have much homework these days.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				This example refers to an unspecified, unquantifiable amount of homework, so homework is an uncountable noun.
			</p>
		<h2 id="xi">>ðŸ“—Possessive nouns</h2>
			<p>
				Possessive nouns are nouns which possess something; i.e., they have something. You can identify a possessive
				noun by the apostrophe; most nouns show the possessive with an apostrophe and an s.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>The cat's toy was missing.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				The cat possesses the toy, and we denote this by use of â€™s at the end of cat.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a singular noun ends in the letter s or z, the same format often applies. This is a matter of style, 
				however, and some style guides suggest leaving off the extra s.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>I have been invited to the bossâ€™s house for dinner.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>Mrs. Sanchezâ€™s coat is still hanging on the back of her chair.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Plural nouns ending in s take only an apostrophe to form a possessive.
			</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>My niecesâ€™ prom dresses were exquisite.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
